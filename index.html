          <h1>Success Tools</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>
              As a professional motivational speaker and a life coach,
              I often admonish my audience that success is not an enigmatic or elusive phenomenon preserved for the
              selected few endowed with an infallible prowess.
              The sky is big enough for every star to shine and there is a room for all of us in the rendezvous of success!
              Success can be achieved by studying and applying empirically proven principles of success which
              have been used by the luminaries who have achieved gigantic success.
              To be a winner in life you only need to do what successful
              people have done and you will get the same results that they got in any sphere of life.
              The following constitutes an abridged selection of principles or laws of success which
              you can use as a starting point towards a winner’s journey.

              <hr>
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      <em class="red-text">Law of vision</em> – You must have a mental picture of your future in the present projected in every aspect of
                      your life.
                      Visionaries do not do things inline with where they come from but in line with where they are going!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <em class="red-text">Law of Stratagem life planning</em> – The best buildings that we see in life are a product of thorough planning,
                      experts in the field of architecture , town planning and design studies  will often tell you that they
                      finish the product in their minds before they begin to build or design their projects materially.
                      Using this premise as a metaphor it’s very imperative for you to plan your life strategically.
                      You need to invest time to plan your life in line with your vision.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <em class="red-text">Law of Road Map development</em>- The next step is to turn your plan in to a ‘Road Map’ that will guide
                      your life by synthesising all the variables emerging from your strategic life planning phase.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <em class="red-text">Law of Praxis</em>- Dr Kwame Nkrumah, the great writer who was also the first President of Ghana after
                      independence  in his book titled ‘Axioms of Kwame Nkrumah’ aptly wrote “to be successful we must think as
                      people of action and act as people of thinking”. This axiom is the best way of explaining the law of praxis,
                      the law of praxis presupposes that for one to be a winner in life he/she must turn ideas in to practical
                      steps and take practical steps informed by ideas. In other words one must develop an action plan in the
                      pursuit of greatness.
